# 0x16 - Simple Shell Project 🚀

Welcome to 0x16, a C-based Simple Shell implementation developed as a significant milestone project within the ALX Africa Software Engineering curriculum. 💻

## Project Overview 📋

The "Gates of Shell" project, an integral part of the first trimester coursework, serves as a comprehensive exploration of advanced concepts that underlie shell programming. By delving into topics such as processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling, this project equips students with a profound understanding of the intricacies of shell programs. 📚

## Features ✨

- Basic UNIX command interpreter 📜
- Replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh) 🔄
- Emphasizes core concepts including process management, system calls, and more 💪
- Written entirely in the C programming language ✏️
